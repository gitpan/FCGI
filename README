This is a Fast CGI module for perl. It's based on the FCGI module
that comes with Open Market's FastCGI Developer's Kit, but does
not require you to recompile perl.

It does require that perl is compiled with sfio though.
Therefore you'll need at least perl 5.003_02 and you'll have
to have configured it with eg './Configure -Duseperlio -Dusesfio' .

It might work without sfio with an upcoming glibc release.

See http://www.fastcgi.com/ for more information about fastcgi.
Lincoln D. Stein's perl CGI module also contains some information
about fastcgi programming.

See echo.fpl for an example on how to use this module.

To install, do the usual

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

If Makefile.PL finds an already installed (exported) fcgi library
it will use that instead of the included files. Edit Makefile.PL
if you don't want that or if it doesn't find them.

If you're on a solaris system and your installed fcgi library is 2.02b
or earlier, you'll probably want to use the included files.

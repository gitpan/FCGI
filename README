This is a Fast CGI module for perl. It's based on the FCGI module
that comes with Open Market's FastCGI Developer's Kit, but does
not require you to recompile perl.
It does require that perl is compiled with sfio though.
Therefore you'll need at least perl 5.003_02 and you'll have
to have configured it with eg './Configure -Duseperlio -Dusesfio' .

See http://www.fastcgi.com/ for more information about fastcgi.
Lincoln D. Stein's perl CGI module also contains some information
about fastcgi programming.

See echo.fpl for an example on how to use this module.
If you don't get any immediate output with $| set, you're
using apache and you care about this, apply the following patch:

you need to add the following line
to DrainReqOutBuf() function in mod_fastcgi: 
    if(!reqPtr->connection->aborted) {
        bwrite(reqPtr->connection->client, begin, count);
+	bflush(reqPtr->connection->client);
    }

This is a Fast CGI module for perl. It's based on the FCGI module
that comes with Open Market's FastCGI Developer's Kit, but does
not require you to recompile perl.
It does require that perl is compiled with sfio though.
Therefore you'll need at least perl 5.003_02 and you'll have
to have configured it with eg './Configure -Duseperlio -Dusesfio' .

If you don't know whether your perl has been compiled with sfio,
you can test it with

perl -V:usesfio

The module currently does not check whether this is the case
and will not compile or in any case not work if it isn't.

No documentation yet.
See http://www.fastcgi.com/ for more information about fastcgi.
Lincoln D. Stein's perl CGI module also contains some information
about fastcgi programming.
